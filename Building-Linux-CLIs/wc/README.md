# Readme
- The only difference from wc output is that the 'base-error' is printed in lowercase, i.e 'is a directory' instead of 'Is a directory'
- Keeping multi-flag output same as wc output so that test case solutions can be quickly obtained (commented out code for extra space)
- Story 4: No test cases added in the interest of time
- Story 5: Test cases added only for "-lwc" instead of combinations of "-l -w -c" in the interest of time
